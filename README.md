The marketing and brand strategy team has recently conducted a segmentation analysis of their customer base, focusing specifically on healthcare professionals (HCPs).
As part of this effort, they identified a key segment referred to as “Patient Advocates”—HCPs believed to be highly motivated by outcomes that directly benefit their
patients, such as treatment efficacy, tolerability, and patient support programs.
To evaluate the value of this segmentation, the brand team launched a targeted pilot initiative across two selected sales regions.
In this pilot, sales representatives were trained to deliver tailored messaging specifically designed to appeal to the motivations of Patient Advocates.
The goal of this messaging was to increase the number of new patients initiated on the product, measured through new-to-brand prescriptions (NBRx).
Now, the brand team would like your analytical support in evaluating the effectiveness of this pilot. Specifically, 
they are asking for your help in determining whether the targeted approach resulted in meaningful improvement in patient initiations—and whether this
segmentation and targeted messaging strategy should be expanded to the rest of the sales organization.
